    <p>In April, a fishing boat was bobbing along in the Arctic Ocean. As it sailed near the coast of Norway, a country
      in Europe, a fisherman on the boat spotted a beluga whale.The whale was wearing clips that hold a camera. Why
      would a whale need a camera? Could the animal be a spy?
      The answer just might be yes! The whale also had clips on its harness with the words “St. Petersburg.” That’s the
      name of a city in Russia. Officials say this means the whale was likely trained by the Russian military as a spy.
      This may seem a bit fishy. But whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals are used to help militaries around the
      world. That includes the United States military. The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program currently has more than 100
      sea animals protecting our country from underwater threats.


      The Best of the Best

      The Navy program started in 1959. In the early years, the Navy tested out more than a dozen animals, including
      sharks, sea turtles, and birds. Today just two species are used: bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions.
      “The Navy’s dolphins and sea lions perform missions that the Navy cannot yet accomplish in any other way,” says
      Mark Xitco. He’s the director of the program.
      Both animals are very smart and easy to train. And both can quickly adapt to different environments, like shallow
      waters or deep seas.
      But there are more dolphins in the program because they use echolocation. That means they use sound to “see”
      underwater!

      On the Job

      Dolphins begin training at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California, when they’re a few years old. Handlers
      show them how to look for and mark the locations of underwater explosives called mines. Mines could hurt or kill
      people on military ships. And they can be difficult for humans to detect.
      But it’s no problem for dolphins. Using echolocation, the animals can easily “see” through dark, muddy waters.
      Plus, they can dive hundreds of feet below the surface, much farther than humans can. Trainers also teach dolphins
      to identify enemy swimmers.
      “The animals are natural hunters,” says Xitco. “We just change what they learn to hunt for.”


      Reporting for Duty

      In the past 40 years, Navytrained animals have traveled to the coasts of more than a dozen countries on official
      missions. When they aren’t on a mission, the dolphins help with security at Navy bases around the world and
      prepare for future jobs.
      “They will be ready if they are needed,” says Xitco. “Navy dolphins and sea lions are always on duty.”
